The concept of Aniamlgame is to have a forest with some animals in it. I have her 4 kinds of animals like Tiger, lion,Elephant and deer. From the animals, we randomly pick a carnivore animal and make it fight if it have the required minimum strength and have some hunger. The animal fights with the nearby animals and the process repeats until no carnivore animal can fight or all are dead. Finally we print who all are alive.

In the latest version I also introduced a hunter to the game and the hunter picks a random animal category (Lion,Tiger etc..)to hunt and find the nearest animal of that category and the tries to hunt it.
